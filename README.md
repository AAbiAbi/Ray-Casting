# Ray-Casting
implement ray casting algorithm
In this assignment, you will implement ray casting algorithm. 
Follow the lecture content, write a program to generate the ray casting result.
The objects in the scene are spheres.
You need to define in your program: 

```
the light source intensity (R, G, B),  
light source location (Lx, Ly, Lz),  
eye location (Ex, Ey, Ez),  
one plane and at least 2 spheres 
location/radius of spheres,  
surface property (K value in the lighting model), view plane size/location (perpendicular to z axis)
```
Your result should be showing 2 shaded spheres (or more), with one sphere casting a shadow on the other a ( after your program works, just change the sphere location or light location to get shadow)

Extra credit:   
- Ground plane. with sphere shadows on it   
- Reflection and refraction.    
- Environment map
